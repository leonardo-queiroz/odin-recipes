    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pottage or what remains of it in UK is a stove-top stew that would have been eaten by the majority of people in the Britain and Northern Europe for centuries.
        It is the ultimate one pot meal that would have kept going all week. Traditionally it would have made use of what was obtainable at the time and would 
        have been added to as the week went on. If there was any meat available, most likely a rabbit, this would have been chucked in too.</p>
    <p>The recipe here aims to keep within those past traditions, potatoes didn't arrive into Europe until the latter part of the 16th Century.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A knob of butter/Or  2 tbs of oil to keep it vegan</li>
        <li>1-2 large onions</li>
        <li>2 leeks</li>
        <li>2 celery sticks</li>
        <li>4 large carrots</li>
        <li>1 swede (or 2-3 turnips)</li>
        <li>3 parsnips</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>1/2 a cup of porridge oats</li>
        <li>A few sprigs of wild garlic</li>
        <li>A handful of fresh mixed herbs, sage, thyme, rosemary or whatever is available</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the butter/oil in a large stock pot/Dutch oven over a low-medium flame.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is warm, add the sliced/diced onions, leeks and celery to the pot and stir before covering over with the lid to soften for approx ten minutes.</li>
        <li>Then add the chopped root vegetables, stir and leave for a few minutes to soften and take on the flavour of the onions and leeks.</li>
        <li>Add at least enough water to cover the vegetables, more if you want to thin it out and make it go further, increase the heat and bring to the boil.</li>
        <li>Then reduce the heat so it is just simmering and add the oats to thicken and herbs for flavour. Top up with more water if necessary.</li>
        <li>Leave to simmer for about an hour, then taste!</li>
    </ol>
