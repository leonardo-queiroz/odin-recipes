    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Scott was lucky enough to be given this recipe by one of the schools he visited recently as they were learning about Viking food and were keen to try it. 
        Using a whole chicken also gives the children a chance to understand where their meat comes from, although if you are pushed for time, 
        a mix of thighs and drumsticks will work just as well.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole free range chicken (or 1kg thighs and drumsticks)</li>
        <li>4 carrots</li>
        <li>3 onions</li>
        <li>1 swede</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>A dash of ground black pepper</li>
        <li>500ml of good stock fresh herbs (thyme and sage work well)</li>
        <li>1 Bayleaf</li>
        <li>1 large knob of butter for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the chicken into about 8 pieces (thighs, drumsticks halve the breasts). The skin can be left on or off depending on preference.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice the onions and  peel and chop the root veg into 2cm chunks.</li>
        <li>Over a hot Dutch oven or stock pot add the butter before frying off the chicken meat until it is brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Season the meat with the salt and pepper before adding the vegetables and herbs to the pot, before pouring in the stock.</li>
        <li>Boil for about 20 minutes until the vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Serve with <a href="./tunnbrod.html">Tunnbrod</a>.</li>
    </ol>
